                <li>
                    <h3><i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i> Heart health</h3>
                    <p>Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to
                        healthier hearts. Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood
                        pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga. </p>
                    <p>Try it: <strong>Downward Dog Pose</strong>
                        <br>
                        Get on all fours, then tuck your toes under and bring
                        your sitting bones up, so that you make a
                        triangle shape. Keep a slight bend in your knees, while lengthening your spine and tailbone.</p>

                    <h3><strong> <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i> Better sleep</strong></h3>
                    <p>When measuring sleep, researchers look at a person's ability to both fall asleep and stay
                        asleep.Yoga has been shown to improve both how
                        quickly people fall asleep and how deeply they stay asleep. This is partly due to the
                        aftereffects of exercise and the mental calming and stress relief provided by yoga specifically

                        <p>Try It: <strong>Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose</strong>
                            <br>
                            Sit with your left side against a wall, then gently turn right and lift your legs up to rest
                            against the wall, keeping your back on the floor and your sitting bones close to the wall.
                            You can remain in this position for 5 to 15 minutes. </p>

                    <h3><i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-child-reaching"></i> <strong>Back pain relief</strong></h3>
                    <p>Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower
                        back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for
                        chronic low back pain.
                        <p>Try it: <strong>Cat-Cow Pose</strong>
                            <br>
                            Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath
                            your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward the floor. Then, exhale,
                            as you draw your navel toward your spine, arching your spine like a cat stretching.

            <h2>About Modern Yoga</h2>
            <p>Modern yoga is a wide range of yoga practices with differing purposes, encompassing in its various forms
                yoga philosophy derived from the Vedas, physical postures derived from Hatha yoga, devotional and
                tantra-based practices, and Hindu nation-building approaches. </p>

            <p> The scholar Elizabeth de Michelis proposed a 4-part typology of modern yoga in 2004, separating modern
                psychosomatic, denominational, postural, and meditational yogas. Other scholars have noted that her work
                stimulated research into the history, sociology, and anthropology of modern yoga, but have not all
                accepted her typology. They have variously emphasised modern yoga's international nature with its
                intercultural exchanges; its variety of beliefs and practices; its degree of continuity with older
                traditions, such as ancient Indian philosophy and medieval Hatha yoga; its relationship to Hinduism; its
                claims to provide health and fitness; and its tensions between the physical and the spiritual, or
                between the esoteric and the scientific.</p>
            <p> By 2012, there were at least 19 widespread styles from Ashtanga Yoga to
                Viniyoga. These emphasise different aspects including aerobic exercise, precision in the asanas, and
                spirituality in the Haṭha yoga tradition. For example, Bikram Yoga has an aerobic exercise style with
                rooms heated to 105 °F.
            </p>
